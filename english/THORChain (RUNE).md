## Overview

THORChain is a decentralised liquidity network aimed to allow permissionless trading/swapping between different blockchains i.e. BTC <-> ETH <-> BNB <-> DOGE <-> SOL and more. Users can trade freely without a 3rd party exchange like Coinbase or Binance, reducing custody, censorship, and counterparty risks. 

## Background

Currently, majority of trading activity on cryptocurrencies are done on centralised exchanges, with $8.6 trillion in total spot volume from January to June 2021 alone. Though blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum tout permissionless, trustless and censorship resistant properties, the underlying infrastructure (trading) cannot say the same for itself. This remains as a large attack vector for the digital asset space i.e. China and exchange hacks/insolvency. We have seen how important decentralised exchanges (DEX) are with the rise of Uniswap, allowing self-custodial and trustless swapping of assets on Ethereum. Thorchain seeks to create a cross-chain DEX and liquidity network, bringing trustless swaps between Bitcoin, Ethereum, USDT/USDC, and more.     

Thorchain’s development team remain pseudonymous. 

## Investment Thesis

**Cross-chain Swaps**

We have seen Ethereum concede DeFi market share to alternative, cheaper Layer 1 platforms like Avalanche, Terra, Fantom, Solana – mainly owing to restrictive gas prices. What this does is creates severe fragmentation, and the users are forced to silo their liquidity, which also gives them limited options to move their liquidity. Currently, for users to move their liquidity across various chains, and take advantage of the Dapps that reside on them – they are forced to use 2 options- CEX's and Cross-Chain bridges - and the problem with both of them is centralisation. Using CEX's means trusting the third party to custody your assets, and trust them to have enough liquidity to withdraw it to another chain. Using Cross chain bridges also entails centralisation risks, as all bridges are controlled by multi-sigs and are succesptible to hacks. ($300m Ethereum-Solana Wormhole Bridge Hack).


**Multichain Future**

There are numerous chains that are achieving market demand aside from Bitcoin and Ethereum. We’ve mainly seen activity initially transfer over to Polygon and Solana in the initial parts of 2021 and in 2022 – we’ve seen Fantom and Avalanche emerge as strong alternative DeFi ecosystems. Users who wish to trade or shift funds from different blockchains will go through centralized exchanges or Thorchain. Even L2s such as Arbitrum and Optimism will likely use Thorchain for faster swaps between Ethereum.
 

**Deterministic Price of RUNE**

In any financial market, liquidity begets liquidity. If Thorchain becomes the default layer where users, exchanges, institutions, OTC desks, etc., source their Layer 1 assets such as BTC, liquidity will be sucked out from other CEXes and DEXes into Thorchain. The more trading activity on Thorchain, the more liquidity providers are incentivized to pool onto Thorchain. Since RUNE’s value is tied to at least 3x the value of liquidity provided on Thorchain, RUNE has the strongest value capture in the crypto space. 

 
**DEXes are The Future**

Total crypto currency spot exchnage volumes have crossed ~$16 tillion over the last year, and a majority of this activity happens on CEXes. The DEX/CEX spot volume ratio is currently around 12%. There is a huge gap between users of CEXes and DEXes, and as the market matures, individuals will eventually port over to DEXes instead. DEXes are expected to become more of a backend tool for DeFi, with constant usage. 

## Catalysts 

* Multichain relaunch
* Thorchain Synths
* Thorwallet mobile application

  
## TAM & Valuation 

* Counterintuitively, RUNE’s addressable market is the ~$2 trillion worth of digital assets, not the amount of trading volume in the digital asset market. RUNE’s value accrual mechanism makes it such that the market cap of RUNE will be at least 3x of liquidity provided on Thorchain. 

**Scenario Analyses**

Let us simulate the amount of liquidity Thorchain can capture by looking at TVLs of other DEXes. The Calculation of market cap of RUNE will be done by diving TVL by 2 and multiplying it by 3.  
•	This is because liquidity providers must sell half their assets for RUNE, hence dividing by 2 first. 

Currently, there’s around $34.7bn in TVL on the top DEXes across Ethereum L1s and L2s, Avalanche, Cosmos. Assuming THORChain captures 10% of all the TVL on other DEXes – that translates to a total TVL of ~$3.4bn of assets. Since the amount of RUNE needs to be 3x the amount of assets in liquidity pools – we can imply a RUNE market cap of $5.02bn, which puts RUNE’s price at ~$10.41. This is the most important part of RUNE’s tokenomic model – as liquidity increases, the amount of RUNE bonded also needs to increase, which ultimately pushes up the price of RUNE.

## Industry Outlook 

Currently, for users to natively swap assets between different blockchains, they have to use either centralized exchanges, or bridges – that involve wrapped or pegged tokens. The problem with bridges is that today, a majority of the bridges are used to move liquidity between Ethereum and other EVM compatible blockchains. This again, makes it hard to swap assets that are on chains that are not EVM compatible.  

Spot Crypto volumes have soared, with over ~$16 trillion in total cryptocurrency exchange volume in the last year. These volumes are likely to grow in a similar manner in the foreseeable future. 
The DEX to CEX spot ratio stands at around 12% - which shows the dominance (and reliance) on Centralized Exchanges. This is also a useful indicator to the maturity of the market – with a majority of crypto natives preferring to use DEXes. 

Of those that use DEXes – for cross chain transactions, or using assets on other chains – they have to go through bridges. 

Total Value Locked in Bridges on Ethereum: $22.47bn 

TVL locked in THORChain: $314m

The amount of value THORChain can pull in, is easily apparent.

## Technology

There is currently no efficient way of executing cross-chain swaps trustlessly. Thorchain seeks to solve this by creating a model where node/vault operators are economically incentivised to honestly facilitate cross-chain swaps, similar to how Bitcoin miners are economically incentivised not to 51% attack their network. 

1.	Node operators bond RUNE to earn trading fees on Thorchain. 
2.	These node operators hold the assets that liquidity providers provide i.e. ETH or BTC, and sends out i.e. BTC to a user that swapped his ETH for BTC. 
3.	Since RUNE’s value is tied to the health of the network, malicious behavour from node operators that harms Thorchain will harm the value of their bonded RUNE. 
a.	Why Thorchain cannot use other assets, i.e. ETH, for node operators to bond, is because ETH will still have value if Thorchain is compromised, and there will be little to no negative effect on node operators’ bond.

Why would liquidity providers use Thorchain? 
1.	Liquidity providers on DEXes i.e. Uniswap and Sushiswap, receive trading fees, earning yield on their capital. 
2.	The highest trading volume pairs are BTC/USDT, ETH/USDT, DOGE/USDT, XRP/USDT, SOL/USDT, a majority of which are not supported by Ethereum-based DEXes. These high volume pairs will generate high amounts of trading fees for their liquidity providers.

Trustlessness/Security/Decentralisation ranking
1.	Ethereum/Bitcoin
2.	Ethereum—based DEXes i.e. Uniswap
3.	Thorchain
4.	DeFi applications controlled by multi-sigs 
5.	Centralised exchanges

## Thorfi
* Borrowing
    * LPs can borrowing from their position in order to receive yield from trading fees while unlocking capital. If yields are higher than the interest rate, the loan will be self-repaying.
* Synths 
    * In order to facilitate faster trading and settlement times, Thorchain will implement synths, which are redeemable for RUNE + the underlying asset i.e. 1 BTC synth redeemed for 0.5 BTC and the equivalent RUNE value. 
* Single-sided staking
    * Users are able to stake asset single-sidedly to earn yield i.e. BTC. This will likely draw users which are currently staked at providers such as BlockFi and Celsius. 


## Token (RUNE)

* 3x value of RUNE is required for node/vault operators and liquidity providers to earn yield on their assets, hence the marketcap of RUNE will be at least 3x the value of non-RUNE total valued locked.
* Total supply capped at 500m RUNE and was distributed as follows:
    * Protocol Emissions: 220,447,472 (43.87%)
    * Operational Reserves: 65 million (12.94%)
    * Community Reserve (RUNEVault): 65 million (11.94%)
    * Team and Advisors: 50 million (9.95%)
    * Seed investors: 30 million (5.97%)
    * Private Sale: 70 million (13.93%)
    * IDO: 7 million (1.39%)
    * The sum of these would be 502,447,472. It is assumed that the Thorchain team had burnt the additional 2,447,472 tokens.

**Emission schedule:** 

1.	According to the Thorchain team’s unupdated token release schedule, RUNE’s 10-year emission schedule is as follows:

2.	The release schedule incorporates a team and seed token unlock schedule starting from Jul 2021. However, these tokens will only start to unlock when Thorchain achieves mainnet, which seems to be pushed back to early 2022.

## SWOT Analysis

Strengths: 

1.	Tackling a large market gap in crypto. There currently is no other way for cross-chain native swaps in a completely trustless manner. 
2.	RUNE has a strong token value accrual model. As THORChain usage grows, so will the amount of RUNE required to be bonded. 
3.	Relatively complete protocol, left with bug squashing and battle-testing. 

Weaknesses:

1.	Providing a code-based bridge for ERC20 tokens has multiple attack vectors. Since ERC20 tokens can be created by anyone with limitless programmability, ERC20s may prove to be unworkable for Thorchain due to potential exploits. 
2.	Exposure to RUNE may cause a hesitancy for liquidity providers to move over to THORChain. 

Opportunities: 

1.	Regulatory and centralized exchange crackdowns could lead to more users on Thorchain.
2.	Growing number of hacks and exploits on bridges could lead to more users on Thorchain. 
3.	UST pools will boost the activity on Thorchain, as it is the most in demand algorithmic stablecoin. 

Threats: 

1.	Other competitors creating a more adopted version of cross-chain swaps . 
2.	LayerZero like communication protocols that use different method for cross-chain swaps without exposure to a core asset. 
3.	Users view trustlessness as a spectrum, and prefer the convenience and lower fees of bridges over Thorchain. 

**Roadmap**

1.	Mainnet launch (Q1 2022)
2.	THORFi - Synths, savings account, lending and composite assets.
3.	Unlimited Staking (no caps)
4.	Support an additional 15 chains 
5.	Handover of protocol development and treasury 
6.	Planned obsolescence for the team to decentralize the protocol.



## Key Issues & Risks
* Current volume does not justify current marketcap.
* Unknown timeline to completion of mainnet; other cross-chain services such as Chainflip may steal market share.
