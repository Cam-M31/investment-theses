## Overview
Terra is a smart contract platform laser-focused on real-world adoption, where users have their checking, savings, investing account and more financial applications all in one place. Terra applications are all powered by their native stablecoins, which must be issued by burning LUNA. Significant adoption and demand for their applications would increase demand for Terra stablecoins, and hence LUNA.  

## Background

The advent of Bitcoin gave the people a choice to subscribe to a global form of monetary policy that is not subject to the whims of central banks and inflationary monetary policies, which was revolutionary. However, the volatile nature of BTC makes it hard to use as a medium of exchange in trade and financial applications. Terra seeks to combine the best of fiat and Bitcoin into one, by creating price-stable currencies backed by their native token, LUNA. 



## Investment Thesis

**Financial application layer for global adoption:** 
* Terra focuses on user experience:
    * Allows users to use Terra stablecoins to transact on real-world platforms via Chai and other upcoming applications.
    * Savings account via Anchor 
    * Investment account via Mirror 
    * Upcoming Dapps include insurance, yield aggregators and more payment platforms
* Anyone can use Terra as long they have a smartphone and internet connection

**Deterministic link between LUNA and blockchain usage.** 

To use Terra applications, users would have to get Terra native stablecoins (mainly UST) which are backed by LUNA. For example, if users want to earn 20% interest on their savings on Anchor protocol, they will have to deposit UST. UST is generated by burning LUNA, and can be redeemed for 1 USD worth of LUNA, creating a value-backed stablecoin. The more UST users need, the more LUNA burnt, which will help appreciate LUNA’s price. 

**Deflationary LUNA Tokenomics.** 

Every time UST needs to be used (i.e. – most of the applications on the Terra blockchain need to be used) – LUNA is burned from supply. Add to this the Columbus-5 upgrade, which now burns all the seigniorage that would’ve otherwise accrued to the rewards pool – LUNA has seen a net reduction of 82m in its circulating supply over the last year. At this rate, and continued increase in demand for UST, we could see an increasing amount of LUNA being taken out of supply. 

**Growing DeFi Ecosystem and UST Supply**

When Terra launched, there were only two protocols – Anchor and Mirror. However, the ecosystem seems to be rapidly maturing with a number of DeFi protocols that have launched – Astroport (a DEX), Stader Labs (a liquid staking protocol), Orca (allows you to bid for discounted LUNA from liquidation events) – and many more in the pipeline. Add to this the exponential growth of UST supply – up 3500% over the last year - from 300 million to 11 billion, Terra is well positioned to handle a dearth of DeFi activity. 


## Catalysts: 

* Growing demand for Algorithmic stablecoins (as we have seen with MIM and UST growth over the last year). UST supply up 35x over the last year – with a potential target of $50bn in 2022. 
* New DeFi primitives on Terra – we have seen the DeFi landscape on Terra move from 0-1 within a year, with protocols like White Whale, Kujira, and PRISM Finance building out the core of the DeFi ecosystem – allowing for more advanced DeFi applications to be built out on top. 
* The UX on Terra is highly optimized, with fast transaction finality, a clean interface, and low fees. 

## Active Network Participation

M31 is an active participant in the LUNA ecosystem, helping add value and strength to the network – while generating extra yield vs passive holding of the assets. We currently help secure the network through LUNA staking – earning staking rewards, as well as airdrops for protocols that build on the blockchain. 

## TAM & Valuation: 

* Terra’s TAM would be the world’s entire money supply, but is improbable that they totally replace fiat. 
* We can approximate LUNA’s value capture in two ways.
    * Looking at the current stablecoin supply 
    * Looking at the monetary supply of countries that would need Terra’s financial services 
* The current stablecoin supply including other algorithmic stablecoins is $111bn. 
    * USD deposited on AAVE and Compound = $17,738,400,000
    * With Orion, which provides a gateway for USDT/USDC/DAI to be converted into UST to use in Anchor for higher interest rates than AAVE and Compound, Terra should be able to capture that value.
    * If $10bn wants to be converted to UST from USDT/USDC/DAI, with the current UST supply being <$2bn and most being used in Mirror and Anchor, there would be an extreme supply shortage. Most of it should be used to buy LUNA from the market and burn that LUNA to mint UST. 
    * There is only 81m unstaked LUNA right now, at $5.79, for a total cap of $469m.
    * It is hard to calculate an exact valuation based on this, because LUNA will be burnt to mint UST, reducing its total supply. But let us say all 416.7m circulating supply will be bought to mint $10bn worth of UST. Each LUNA would have to be $24 then. 
    * Or if we take the unstaked supply of 81m LUNA, it would be $123.46 per token. 
    * If we take a supply of 250m LUNA instead, because some would be unstaked and some would stay staked, it would be $40 per token.    
* Now let us take a bottom-up approach, where financial services on Terra will serve smaller or developing countries like Korea, Thailand, Mexico, Philipines and more.
* Terra stablecoins will be bought by Terra users, so we can evaluate the demand for Terra stablecoins by taking the % market cap of the countries’ monetary supply. 
* The sheet below shows how much buying pressure there would be if Terra siphons off some of each currency’s supply.

## Industry Outlook 
* There are several Layer 1 smart contract platforms, such as Ethereum, Solana, and Cosmos, but none of them are anywhere near ready for real-world adoption due to either scaling issues or lack of applications. 
* Terra’s focus is on adoption and decentralising later. It is better to think of it as a fintech application rather than a crypto-native platform. 
* Terra’s Korea-based payment app currently has 77k daily active users, 130k daily transactions and 2.4 million total users.
* With Anchor’s fixed savings rate of 20% which is much higher than TradFi competitors, and the convenience of using Mirror, Terra looks poised to increase its retail adoption rate. 
* Even though Terra is the home of UST, the algorithmic stablecoin can be used on any blockchain. If UST becomes the number one decentralised stablecoin, that would surge the demand for UST and LUNA. 
 
## Competitors

**Crypto Competitors:** 
* Algorithmic stablecoins
    * MakerDao – Mint DAI with collateral 
    * Reflexer Finance – Mint RAI with ETH 
    * Reserve Protocol(?) 
* Layer 1 platforms:
    * Ethereum
    * Solana
    * Cosmos
    * NEAR
    * Avalanche 

## Recent Trends & Changes

* Growing DeFi ecosystem on Terra over the last year. 100+ applications building/to be launched. 
* Mainstream Partnerships – MLB franchise Washington Nationals and Terra inked a $38m, 5 year partnership. 

## Technology:
* Terra is built on the Cosmos SDK as a smart contract platform secured by their delegated proof-of-stake model. Only the top 100 validators comprise the validating set. 
    * Validators and delegators may be slashed if the validator double signs a transaction, has significant downtime or missed too many oracle votes. 
* On Terra’s algorithmic stablecoins i.e. UST or TerraKRW 
    * When UST price > 1 USD, users and arbitragers can send 1 USD worth of Luna to the system and receive 1 UST. This happens when there is more demand for UST due to the inherent attractiveness of the decentralised stablecoin or demand to use Terra applications. 
    * When UST price < 1 USD, users and arbitragers can send 1 UST to the system and receive 1 USD’s worth of Luna. 
    * Essentially LUNA absorbs the volatility of Terra stablecoins. When demand for Terra stablecoins increase, LUNA price increases, and vice versa. 
    * If the Terra ecosystem has a high level of adoption, billions or even trillions of stablecoins must be minted to support activity on the ecosystem, and the value will accrue to LUNA holders. 
    	
## Token (LUNA): 
* Emissions will be maxed out at 1 billion LUNA, but the supply of LUNA is elastic and may go over 1 billion when UST is redeemed for LUNA. 
* LUNA can be staked via their delegated proof-of-stake system to earn:
    * Gas fees
    * Taxes, which is a transaction fee ranging from 0.1% to 1% on every Terra transaction, capped at 1 TerraSDR(?)
    * Seignorage rewards when participating in the LUNA exchange rate oracle process
    * Initial and continuous airdrops from Terra applications e.g. Mirror and Anchor
* When LUNA in unstaked, it goes through a 21 day unbonding phase where the token does not accrue rewards and cannot be traded.

## SWOT Analysis

Strengths: 

1.	Smart contract platform aimed at retail adoption, unlike others. 
2.	Already has a payment application, savings account and investment platform that is easy and cheap to use. 
3.	Strong tokenomics with high value accrual.
4.	Has strong advantages if they reach out to less developed countries in Africa or SEA. 
5.	Can be the all-in-one fintech application. 

Weaknesses: 

1.	No blockchain query platform to allow for in-depth chain analysis – similar to Dune on Ethereum. 
2.	Mirror protocol sucks. Anyone who mints mAssets is basically short it. Stocks based on derivatives is very hard to optimize for. 
3.	Small validator set.
4.	Although Terra claims to be able to scale up to 10,000 TPS, it had issues during the May 19 crash when Anchor protocol borrowers tried to repay loans but were stuck. Needs to be battle-tested longer. 

Opportunities: 

1.	Terra only launched Mirror protocol in late 2020 and Anchor in Q1 2021, setting the foundation to become a mainstream financial application. The creation of other protocols like Orion, Stader Labs, Prism, White Whale, Kujira and Ozone will increase Terra’s value proposition and demand for LUNA – while also keeping UST peg in check. 
2.	Stablecoins are a large market, and the current version of algorithmic stablecoins are not great. DAI has become centralized while others struggle to keep their peg. UST could become the de-facto decentralized stablecoin. 2021 saw UST supply cross 10 billion – going cross chain as well.    

Threats: 

1.	Governments banning the use of Terra stablecoins. 
2.	Anchor interest rate too high, which may be unsustainable. 
3.	Compromised validator set. (Can always fork).  

## Key Issues & Risks

* Lack of decentralisation – Terra is a young platform which still requires work from the core team. The validator set is also small, which can be shut down by governments with effort. 
* LUNA’s tokenomics allows for high value capture when Terra stablecoins are in demand, but can also suffer heavily when UST is redeemed for LUNA i.e. May 19.

## CRYPTO-NATIVE DILIGENCE

**Code Audits**
* Certik in May 2020

**Open Source Risk (Forking Risk)**
 * Very little risk – Terra integration with payment partners and liquidity of the ecosystem is very hard to fork.
