# ENS – Bridging Identity across Ethereum

## Overview

We are able to navigate the internet today largely through domain names. We identify popular applications that we use through the website we’re used to hearing. Domain names essentially bridge internet protocol addresses, that look like “192.168.1.1” to a more human readable name, like www.m31.capital. 

On Ethereum and other Layer 1 blockchains, users interact with the chain using wallets. Their wallet addresses look something like this: 0x29D7d1dd5B6f9C864d9db560D72a247c178aE86B; a 42 character hexadecimal string. Obviously, this isn't convenient for users. ENS does to wallet addresses what domain names did to internet protocol addresses: make them human readable. 

## Investment Thesis 

### Major Improvement in Ethereum's UX  

With Ethereum’s focus on being the next infrastructure layer for a decentralized global internet, Ethereum Name Service (ENS) will play a critical role in improving the user experience by 100x. ENS maps human readable names like “m31capital.eth” to machine readable identifiers that Ethereum uses, like wallet addresses, smart contracts, metadata, NFTs etc. ENS becomes the layer of Ethereum that can provide a human readable chain of activity for a user. It becomes the identity bridge to the Ethereum computer. It also makes it much easier to index and make sense of on-chain activity – either from a user point of view, or at a protocol level as well. 

### The Base Social Layer

ENS essentially becomes a user’s social history tag on Ethereum. Today, we’re used to ‘sign in with google’, or ‘sign in with apple’ which we know has improved the UX of web2 by a major factor, but came at a cost of user data privay being violated. 
While interacting with Ethereum, and eventually applications outside of Ethereum, users can sign into and access decentralized applications with their ENS identity. Decentralized social media applications will leverage ENS, video conferencing applications will leverage ENS, a user’s in game experience in will leverage ENS, Ethereum messaging applications will leverage ENS, the possibilities are endless. ENS becomes the base social layer for Ethereum. 

ENS enables ‘Sign in with Ethereum’ which preserves user privacy and data. Domain and subdomain access, completely decentralized. 


### Usage is Soaring

We have seen a large number of users (relatively) pour into the web3 space over the last couple of years, and paired with the NFT boom and a growing application ecosystem, there has been raging demand for ENS domains. 

As of today, there have been a total of 1.3m ENS domains created, with close to 50,000-100,000 new addresses being added every month. May 2022 saw the largest number of ENS registrations in a single month, with ~370k new names.

 # Technology 
 
ENS has two primary components – the ENS registry, and the ENS revolver. 

### ENS Registry
This is the core database of the protocol, and is a smart contract that keeps track (maintains a list) of all domains and subdomains that have been regisytered on the protocol. It keeps track of data like: owner of domains, resolver for the domain, and the caching time-to-live for all records under the domain.
