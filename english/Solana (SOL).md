## Overview

Solana is a fast, secure, and censorship resistant blockchain providing the open infrastructure required for global adoption.

## Background:
The project was started in 2017 by Anatoly Yakovenko and officially launched in March 2020. Solana (often considered as one of the frontrunners to be the “ETH Killer” on Twitter), is a blockchain that’s scalable and provides high throughout with low transaction fees utilizing a “Proof of History'' consensus mechanism alongside a delegated Proof of Stake model. With Ethereum’s largest challenge as of date being scalability (evidenced from the migration of PoW to PoS), and potential L2 compatibility issues, Solana has recently gained traction with notable partnerships with original Ethereum protocols that have focused on a multichain approach (Arweave, USDC, Sushiswap, Terra) alongside Solana exclusive De-Fi projects such as Raydium, Oxygen, Saber, and Project Serum that have gained high traction + TVL.

## Investment Thesis:

**The future of blockchains are multi-chain with niche use cases:**

Although Ethereum is the clear market leader for on-chain activities (NFT’s, De-Fi), Solana can serve high-throughput defi applications for institutions demanding permissionless, scalable crypto via on-chain order books, a feature that Ethereum simply can’t replicate due to slower processing times. Alongside Solana’s active developments in cross-chain interoperability with projects like REN and wormhole, developers are now able to build seamless, cross-chain applications. 

**Rival blockchains are unable to match SOL’s TPS technology and it’s 8 core innovations due to it’s inherent different design path:**

Solana has built their technology from the ground up and have made conscious decisions to structure their blockchain without sharding or L2 technology - (where L2 has valid questions around compatibility, timeline, and end user experience). 

Furthermore, the Solana team argues sharding proves to be problematic because it splits the security. ETH’s heterogeneous L2 scaling creates fragmentation. Issues of differing block times & computational throughput across L2s, lengthy withdrawal times requiring market makers, wallets & devs needing to rework integration with each L2.

## Catalysts:

* Solana raised $314 million from a16z.
* Speculation associated with ETH2 upgrades and current high GAS costs.
* Notable developer + project traction on Solana’s ecosystem - such as Audius raising $3M+ and an NFT platform on Solana raising $3M+.
* Majority of retail proved to be insensitive to consumer facing applications that use a different blockchain (such as NFT’s on Flow).
* Binance Smart Chain illustrating product market fit in which Solana can serve as a further “decentralized” blockchain. 
* Partnerships with original ETH projects that are aiming to go multi-chain.
* “Solana Capital”, which is a fund started by Solana that invests in Solana based projects. 

## TAM & Valuation:

## Industry Outlook:

**7 Day Fees:**
* Solana: $340,775
* Ethereum: $175.33M

**Validators:**
* Solana: 1,748
* Ethereum: 238,099

## Competitors:

* Ethereum: Ethereum serves as the blockchain of choice due to developer + retail traction. With a successful launch of ETH 2 - Solana can serve to be a less relevant blockchain. 
* Interoperability Blockchains ($DOT and $ATOM): Interoperability blockchains such as Cosmos and Polkadot serve to attain several of the same end user experience (high transaction speeds, low cost).
* BSC: Binance Smart Chain is relatively similar in terms of lower transaction costs. One advantage Solana has it’s that it’s “less” decentralized.
* Matic: Plasma and sidechain solutions to solve Ethereum’s scaling challenges.

## Recent Trends and Changes:
* The first SPL token, Raydium, was listed on Binance.
* Saber, the “Curve” for Solana, has hit 600M+ in TVL.
* Solana has hit an ATH for token price on Aug 27th, 2021 → $85.04

## Technology:

The 8 core innovations include:
1.	Proof of History (POH) — a clock before consensus 
2.	Tower BFT — a PoH-optimized version of PBFT
3.	Turbine — a block propagation protocol
4.	Gulf Stream — Mempool-less transaction forwarding protocol
5.	Sealevel — Parallel smart contracts run-time
6.	Pipelining — a Transaction Processing Unit for validation optimization 
7.	Cloudbreak — Horizontally-Scaled Accounts Database
8.	Archivers — Distributed ledger storage

## Token (SOL):

SOLs have two primary use cases within the network.  
1.	Staking: Users can stake their SOL either directly on the network or delegate their holding to an active validator to help secure the network. In return, stakers will receive inflation rewards. Solana has not enabled inflation rewards yet, but it intends to unlock inflation in late 2020 or early 2021. 
2.	Transaction Fees: Users can use SOL to pay for fees for sending transactions or running smart contracts (interacting with applications).

## SWOT Analysis

Strengths:

* No sharding, L1, available to scale to millions of users.
* Programmed in RUST - with organic developer networks growing m/m.

Weaknesses:

* Centralized Validators: The current validating infrastructure on Solana is highly centralized - particularly as validators do not face the risk of slashing.

* According to Solana Beach there are 613 validators on the Mainnet Beta. At the moment, the only way that slashing would be imposed wouldn’t be manually (and therefore not algorithmically) from the Solana Foundation itself.

Opportunities:

* Saber is already #101 by TVL among all DeFi protocols on all blockchains

Threats: 
* Arbitrum raising $120 Million



## Projects Overview:

* Raydium: The only difference between Raydium and Uniswap and other AMM’s is that Raydium provides on-chain liquidity to Serum's central limit order book, meaning that Raydium's users and liquidity pools have access to the order flow and liquidity of the entire Serum ecosystem, and vice versa
* Saber: Saber wants to be the Curve for cross-chain stablecoin swapping - enabling low slippage rates across ecosystems.
* Serum: Serum enables cross-chain orderbooks.
* Mango Markets: Initial core features will be fully on-chain margin trading on limit order books as well as perpetual futures.

## Key Insights:

* The only notable (short term?) Solana differentiator is TPS - but this isn’t guaranteed as a competitive advantage in the long run.
* Organic communities (Ethereum) vs inorganic communities? (Solana)
* In the short term, Solana has the ability to access native Ethereum protocols that are looking to go multichain (evidenced by Terra, USDC, USDT, etc)
* An ecosystem of new high quality Dapps are being deployed - and wallets such as Phantom are making it much easier to interact with Solana’s ecosystem.
    * Phantom > Metamask
* The Solana de-fi ecosystem is still so early - Raydium is over 50% of de-fi TVL on Solana, lack of transparent on-chain metrics, etc.
* Serum’s backers (Multicoin Capital, FTX, a16z) will be the key drivers behind Solana’s ecosystem growth, particularly as Serum is still a relatively new platform. Features on the roadmap that haven’t been built yet include: Borrow/lending, Yield, More cross-chain bridges, Projects building on Serum AMMs, Margin trading / contracts, Tokens and exchanges natively supporting SPL Volume and TVL growth etc.
* Solana ecosystem’s long term success/failure will ultimately depend on ETH 2 deployment capabilities and integration opportunities. 
    * Hop Protocol makes it easy to send tokens across scaling solutions: [](https://hop.exchange/)
* Solana projects doing in comparison to EVM compatible sidechains like Matic and BSC
