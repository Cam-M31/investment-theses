## Overview

OHM is a non-sovereign currency like Bitcoin, while OlympusDAO is an independently managed central bank which actively manages the value of OHM. 

The value of OHM is backed by the value of the assets in OlympusDAO’s treasury. When OHM trades below 1 DAI, the protocol buys back and burns OHM; when OHM trades above 1 DAI, the protocol mints and sells new OHM to buy assets for the treasury. Whenever the protocol mints new OHM, stakers are issued more OHM. Investors who wish to acquire OHM also have the option to bond liquidity tokens that helps the DAO acquire liquidity for OHM and receive OHM at a discount.

With the addition of OlympusPro, the protocol’s treasury will be able to acquire tokens from other protocols. 

## Investment Thesis

**The need for a Decentralised Currency**
* Most forms of currency have severely lost purchasing power, while alternatives are not viable either.
  * Gold has not actually outpaced inflation in the past 10 years.
  * BTC or ETH are too volatile.
* By having a treasury reserve with a mix of assets, OlympusDAO can create a currency that is stable in purchasing power.
* Additionally, stablecoins in DeFi are a risk vector

**Liquidity as a service**
* OlympusDAO’s treasury will acquire tokens from other protocols by providing custom treasuries and bonds for protocols to use. 
* OHM will be promoted as a treasury asset and liquidity pair for other protocols


## Background

There are number of issues with today’s form of “currencies”. The Dollar has consistently lost purchasing power over the years, while BTC or ETH are too volatile to be used as an everyday currency. OlympusDAO’s goal is to create a perfect currency that holds the same purchasing power today and in 50 years. 

## Catalysts

* Olympus Pro launching with Abracadabra, Alchemix, Float, Frax, Pendle and StakeDAO

## TAM & Valuation

* Similar to LUNA, OHM’s TAM would be world’s money supply.
* The current stablecoin supply including other algorithmic stablecoins is $129bn. 
  * Unlike LUNA, where main UST demand comes from the demand to use Terra’s applications, OHM’s main use case is to stake to earn more OHM.
  * Before OlympusPro, OHM’s only method of increasing the treasury would be new capital buying or bonding for OHM. 
  * OlympusPro charges a 3.3% fee to bond payouts. 
* We can try quantifying the value capture by OlympusPro by quantifying the value of other protocol’s LM rewards
  * ALPHA = 20% of FD = $240m
  * Thorchain = 44% of FD = $2.1b
  * Sushiswap = 80% of FD = $2.6b
  * Raydium = 34% of FD = $2.6b
  * dYdX = 32.5% of FD = $3.9b
  * Total = $11.44b 
  * These are the largest protocols to date but are not inclusive of all i.e. Pancakeswap, Compound, AAVE, UMA, etc.
* Olympus would take a 3.3% fee, which translates to $377,000. 
  * Variables:
   * It is likely that protocols will not dedicate their entire emissions to OlympusPro
   * Potential appreciation or depreciation of protocol tokens in Olympus’ treasury. 
   * The number of new protocols in the future that will use OlympusPro
* It is hard to speculate the value of OHM without OlympusPro, so we will only use OlympusPro in our scenario analysis.
