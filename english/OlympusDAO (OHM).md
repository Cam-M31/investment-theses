## Overview

OHM is a non-sovereign currency like Bitcoin, while OlympusDAO is an independently managed central bank which actively manages the value of OHM. 

The value of OHM is backed by the value of the assets in OlympusDAO’s treasury. When OHM trades below 1 DAI, the protocol buys back and burns OHM; when OHM trades above 1 DAI, the protocol mints and sells new OHM to buy assets for the treasury. Whenever the protocol mints new OHM, stakers are issued more OHM. Investors who wish to acquire OHM also have the option to bond liquidity tokens that helps the DAO acquire liquidity for OHM and receive OHM at a discount.

With the addition of OlympusPro, the protocol’s treasury will be able to acquire tokens from other protocols. 

## Investment Thesis

**1. The need for a Decentralised Currency**
Most forms of currency have severely lost purchasing power, while alternatives are not viable either. Gold has not actually outpaced inflation in the past 10 year and BTC or ETH are too volatile. By having a treasury reserve with a mix of assets, OlympusDAO can create a currency that is stable in purchasing power.
Additionally, stablecoins in DeFi are a risk vector

**2. Liquidity as a service**
OlympusDAO’s treasury will acquire tokens from other protocols by providing custom treasuries and bonds for protocols to use. OHM will be promoted as a treasury asset and liquidity pair for other protocols. The Olympus Pro model has seen protocols cut down their pool 2 emissions via bond sales. 


## Background

There are number of issues with today’s form of “currencies”. The Dollar has consistently lost purchasing power over the years, while BTC or ETH are too volatile to be used as an everyday currency. OlympusDAO’s goal is to create a perfect currency that holds the same purchasing power today and in 50 years. 

## Catalysts

* Olympus Pro launching with Abracadabra, Alchemix, Float, Frax, Pendle and StakeDAO

## TAM & Valuation

* Similar to LUNA, OHM’s TAM would be world’s money supply.
* The current stablecoin supply including other algorithmic stablecoins is $129bn. 
  * Unlike LUNA, where main UST demand comes from the demand to use Terra’s applications, OHM’s main use case is to stake to earn more OHM.
  * Before OlympusPro, OHM’s only method of increasing the treasury would be new capital buying or bonding for OHM. 
  * OlympusPro charges a 3.3% fee to bond payouts. 
* We can try quantifying the value capture by OlympusPro by quantifying the value of other protocol’s LM rewards
  * ALPHA = 20% of FD = $240m
  * Thorchain = 44% of FD = $2.1b
  * Sushiswap = 80% of FD = $2.6b
  * Raydium = 34% of FD = $2.6b
  * dYdX = 32.5% of FD = $3.9b
  * Total = $11.44b 
  * These are the largest protocols to date but are not inclusive of all i.e. Pancakeswap, Compound, AAVE, UMA, etc.
* Olympus would take a 3.3% fee, which translates to $377,000. 
  * Variables:
   * It is likely that protocols will not dedicate their entire emissions to OlympusPro
   * Potential appreciation or depreciation of protocol tokens in Olympus’ treasury. 
   * The number of new protocols in the future that will use OlympusPro
* It is hard to speculate the value of OHM without OlympusPro, so we will only use OlympusPro in our scenario analysis.

## Industry Outlook
* Creating a new algorithmic currency attempting to sustain the same purchasing power over decades is a herculean task. It is no doubt that OlympusDAO is one of a kind and highly experimental, and is a high-risk, high-reward play. 
* OlympusPro tackles DeFi’s liquidity mining issue, where protocols spend too much capital. Time and energy on liquidity incentives. Olympus will be able to create value by decreasing other protocol’s overhead on liquidity mining, while acquiring tokens of a growing sector at almost no cost.

## Competitors
* Traditional competitors – Not applicable
* Crypto Competitors – Tokemak? 
 * If OlympusPro gets rid of liquidity mining incentives, Tokemak will not be able to farm as much yields as before. 

## Recent Trends & Changes
* Announcement of OlympusDAO

## High-level Overview
**OlympusDAO is backed by DAI but not pegged to anything**

* There is no attempt to stabilise OHM’s price in its current expansionary phase. 
* FEI uses their PCV to control price but not supply, while OHM cares about supply rather than price. 

**OlympusDAO is a real-world experiment on an actively managed currency.**

* OHM is similar to Bitcoin in the sense that it is an asset oriented crypto project with distinct monetary policies, but OlympusDAO has more flexibility to change such policies.
* Although Bitcoin has no protocol-controlled value, it has several entities such as whales and miners which can affect price. 
  * OlympusDAO seeks to be OHM’s biggest whale by controlling liquidity and treasury assets. Similar to how the federal reserve has power over the Dollar.

**OHM phases:**

* The first phase is to attract people by allowing them to benefit financially, making people want to own the asset. 
* The expansion phase is to transition OHM into an asset that other protocols will use. 
* Once OHM holders use OHM for their own agendas, i.e. buying goods and services instead of just staking, OHM will have accomplished their mission.

**Bootstrapping a new currency with memes**

* Bitcoin’s greatest asset is its community. They have bootstrapped a new SoV via memetics. 
* When you long OHM, you are longing the community. 
  * OHM is made up of other members that will stake alongside you, instead of other algo stables where it was mainly player versus player. 
  * The number of evangelists and memes OHM has is its greatest tool. i.e. (3,3)

**Unlike FEI and DAI, OHM holders are also able to govern the protocol, aligning incentives.**

## Technology

* OlympusDAO controls supply expansion and contraction using a protocol managed treasury, protocol owned liquidity, bonding mechanism, and staking rewards 
* Initially, OHM’s goal is not to find a stable price but to achieve profitability to transition into stability and consistency later. 
* Every time someone purchases a bond, the proceeds will go to the Olympus treasury. A corresponding number of OHM will be minted and distributed to 
  * Bonder: Bonders can choose to either bond (sell) single assets or LP tokens for OHM. LP tokens help Olympus control the liquidity of OHM. 
  * The DAO: The DAO receives the same amount of OHM as the bonder which is quoted before bonding.
  * Stakers: Stakers get whatever is left over.
* By increasing the treasury, the protocol increases the intrinsic value of OHM. 
  * The treasury also increases when the protocol mints OHM to sell on the market, also distributing more OHM to stakers in the process. I.e. Selling 1 OHM for 600 DAI allows the protocol to mint 599 more OHM since each OHM only needs to be backed by 1 DAI.   
  * The treasury is used to buyback OHM from the market when the market cap of OHM falls below the treasury value.
  * As long as there are new buyers on the market, OHM will continue to expand. 
* To counter the downward reflexivity seen in other algo stablecoins, the protocol has reserves that will ensure the protocol will never die. 

## Token (OHM)
* As mentioned before, OHM can be staked to earn more OHM.
* The team, investors and advisors were issued 450m of pOHM, which can be redeemed for OHM by burning 1 pOHM and 1 DAI. These tokens are cumulatively vest as 11.8% of OHM supply, which means when there is 1m OHM, a maximum of 118,000 pOHM can be redeemed. This means pOHM is vested linearly on the success of the protocol, and can only be fully redeemed when the supply of OHM reaches 3.8b. 
* pOHM Distribution

## SWOT Analysis

**Strengths:** 

1.	Cult-like community which has shown evidence of holding through OHM’s massive dips. 
2.	The addition of OlympusPro solves a huge market gap in DeFi

**Weaknesses:** 

1.	Main revenue generator for OHM is based on ponzinomics
2.	Highly experimental protocol trying to tackle a herculean task. 

**Opportunities:** 

1.	OHM is more akin to Bitcoin rather than other stablecoins. If OHM can prove to be a new and effective store of value, it could rival Bitcoin’s market cap. 
2.	The addition of OlympusPro is a new revenue source for OHM. 

**Threats:**

1.	Protocol is mainly based on ponzinomics. However, its strong community and addition of OlympusPro has nullified most of the negatives stemming from that.

## Key Issues & Risks
* Treasury is guarded by a 2 of 4 multisig

## Management & Team

**Founder:** Ohmzeus
**Team:** There are no official docs on the team, but there seems to be around 90 pseudo anonymous users on dedicated roles such as front-end, back-end, partnerships, operations, etc on their Discord channel, true to their decetnralised ethos. 


## CRYPTO-NATIVE DILIGENCE

**Code Audits** 
As of now, OlympusDao has been audited by an Omniscia audit. This covers its entire codebase. 
* Link to audit [Omniscia Audit](https://omniscia.io/olympusdao-algorithmic-currency-protocol/)


**Open Source Risk (Forking Risk)**
* Low Forking Risk – OlympusDao is a reserve currency with a unique supply mechanism (rebase mechanism), along with a bond mechanism - that extends to OlympusPro - that is not easy to fork or copy. However, open source code risk is always existent.
