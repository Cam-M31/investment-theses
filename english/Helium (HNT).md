# Overview
Helium is a decentralized, open wireless network provider that intends to provide a network to users and businesses for the providing access to the internet and machine 2 machines transfers for IoT devices.



# Background and General Overview:
The Internet of Things is a ~$600 billion industry, with over 18 billion connected devices online, projected to grow to 30 billion devices by the end of 2022 and spending predicted to reach nearly $1.6 trillion by 2025. Most of these devices need to connect to the Internet to function. However, current solutions such as cellular, WiFi, and Bluetooth are suboptimal: they are too expensive, too power hungry, or too
limited in range.

The Helium network is a decentralized wireless network that enables devices anywhere in the world to wirelessly connect to the Internet and geolocate themselves without the need for power-hungry satellite location hardware or expensive cellular plans. 

Anyone is able to purchase a Helium Hotspot, which they can plug into an electrical outlet and then connect to a local network using Ethernet or Wifi. Each helium Hotspot provides coverage using LongFi technology which is an apache licensed open source protocol in the Sub-GHz frequency band. These radio waves easily pass through walls, floors and concrete. They’re also very low power meaning that IoT devices implementing Long Fi protocol can be thousands of times more battery efficient per bit than cellular data (LTE/5G). 

The consequences of this new technology are profound, enabling IoT devices to communicate with a machine 2 machine network across the globe without having to contrat service providers such as AT&T, and Vodafone for their services. 
 
The Helium Network provides coverage, within a radius of several miles, for IoT devices that relay relatively small amounts of sensor data (e.g. no live streaming audio/video) bandwidth is limited to <5 kbps, which is inconsequential to the host. This will change with the addition and complete rollout of 5G Helium hotspots. Powering the Helium network is a blockchain with a native protocol token incentivizing a two sided marketplace between coverage providers and coverage consumers. With the introduction of a blockchain, Helium injects decentralization into an industry currently controlled by monopolies. The result is that wireless network coverage becomes a commodity, fueled by competition, available anywhere in the world, at a fraction of current costs.

# Investment Thesis

### Fundamentally Superior CapEx Model Compared to Traditional Network Providers:

Historically developing large scale IoT networks has been the major limiting factor in the vision for a world connected by IoT devices. There have been several local-scale deployments of Iot networks over the past decade that have been fundamentally unsuccessful due to the centrally managed, top-down business model of building, owning and managing telecom infrastructure. 

By using a blockchain to coordinate economic incentives, Helium will take advantage of a far less capital intensive approach to creating the network. In order to understand how Helium aims to undercut the market we need to first consider the existing cost structures of the legacy model: 

1.	Expensive proprietary equipment for the network coverage 
2.	Buying/leasing towers
3.	Pay for installation for radio equipment 
4.	Maintenance of the radio equipment 
5.	Maintain a massive back-end infrastructure for customer support, billing
6.	Aggressive marketing and sales expenses

Helium will succeed by reimaging this CapEx structure: 
1.	Consumers by hotshots for hundreds of dollars instead of thousands 
2.	Consumers have “free” rent 
3.	Consumers plug and play hotspots in their homes, giving a labor cost of $0 
4.	Through public key cryptography, blockchains naturally manage customer accounts and billing for free. The Helium blockchain coordinates per byte micropayments between everyone trustlessly. New devices can connect to the network anywhere in the global coverage area without ever needing to sign up with a telecom company. This would be impossible on legacy payment rails.

The Helium network will be able to undercut its competitors. This provides operators of IoT devices with a cheaper alternative to traditional Telecoms, resulting in increased demand for the network, driving up token prices and the rewards in the future. 



Community-driven: 
Hotspots, the backbone of the helium network, are completely non-proprietary. Their hardware and open source software can be developed and assembled by literally anybody around the world. I believe that the community driven nature of the Helium network will only serve to further extend and grow the size of the network. 





Catalysts: 
-	Increased adoption of IoT devices McKinsey composed an article outlining the uptick in IoT connected devices outlining how there seems to be a huge projected increase to 43 billion by 2023, an almost threefold increase from 2018. Advanced principal technologies and a proliferation of devices have proliferation of IoT which are set to grow 
-	Accelerated adoption of IoT catalyzed by structural changes in the economy following COVID-19. Various new devices such as connected thermometers, wearables, and drones have become more used by people and governments due to COVID-19. 


Competitors
-	Traditional competitors to Helium are traditional telecommunications businesses that would normally create the hardware that would be required for this M2M communication. Additionally helium is competing with other locality based IoT network providers including Libelum, Monnit, Konux, Uptake, Arduino, WEIO, Clockwork, Gainspan. These competitors are able to compete with Helium’s low cost infrastructure. However, they don’t possess Helium’s promise of international connectivity.   
-	No real Crypto competitors in the space 


Recent Trends & Changes
-	Recent expansion into europe  (July 2020) 
-	Introduction of a new product: helium tabs. This product allows users of the network to track items. Tab uses LongFi technology to connect with the Helium Blockchain and triangulate where a particular tab is. Each time a tab connects to the network the hotspots used for geolocation earn a reward. 
-	Launch of entrepreneurial projects including the patrons program whereby users of the network who purchase 15 or more Hotspots on the network receive discounts, priority shipping, network tools , and helium support. 















Technology: 

Consensus Mechanism:
Runs on the Helium  Consensus Protocol, and a new king of proof called Proof-Of-Coverage. Miners who are providing wireless  network coverage in a cryptographically verified  physical location and time  submit proofs to the Helium  network.  Miners submitting the best proofs are elected to an asynchronous byzantine fault tolerant consensus group at a fixed time.  The members  of the consensus group receive encrypted transactions submitted by other miners and form them into blocks at an extremely high rate.



Token  (HNT): 
The helium network uses two currency objects: Helium tokens and Helium Network Data Credits. 

Helium tokens are mined  differently than other cryptocurrencies. Every month approx. 5,000,000  new Helium are minted and distributed in a 30/35/35  split between investors, hotspot providers and network data transfer validators. In the future this split is set to heavily favor network data transfer validators.

The distribution of Helium changes over time to align incentives with the needs of the network. In the early days, a higher proportion of Helium was allocated to Hotspot owners for building and securing coverage. As the network grows, Hotspots earn more for transferring device data on the network while Helium Inc. and investors earn less. After 20 years, distributions no longer adjust and remain fixed.

HLM tokens can be converted into Data Credits. Data Credits can only be used to pay for wireless bandwidth; they are non-exchangeable and are tied to a single-user. 


Independent of Network Usage
Each time token distribution occurs, 35% of Helium are distributed to Hotspots in the following manner:

Issuing a challenge: 1%

Encrypted messages are sent from Hotspots over the internet to target Hotspot groups. One percent of Helium Tokens are distributed proportionally to Hotspots that successfully issue challenges.

Proof of Coverage: 19%

Hotspots earn a share of the 19% minted Helium for participating in Proof-of-Coverage, and validating their own and peer’s wireless coverage each time mining occurs. The amount each Hotspot receives depends on how often it is directly involved in Proof-of-Coverage activity.

Witnesses: 9%

Hotspots are designated as “witnesses” when they monitor and report Proof-of-Coverage activity to Hotspots that issue challenges. Witnesses receive a portion of the 9% Helium depending on how much witnessing they perform.

Consensus Group: 6%

Hotspots earn a dynamic score based on the quality of their Proof-of-Coverage participation including acting as witnesses, but not for issuing challenges. For each mining period the highest scoring Hotspots are elected to the consensus group and receive a portion of the 6% distributed to group members.

Dependent on Network Usage
Transferring device data: 30%

Each time mining occurs 30% of Helium are distributed to Hotspots that transfer data from devices on the network. The amount of Helium is allocated proportionally based on the amount of data a Hotspot transferred.




 

SWOT Analysis
Strengths: 
●	Strategic advantage with respect to the cost advantages of the helium network compared to its legacy competitors 
●	Incentivized adoption has seen the market grow extremely quickly in the US since Helium’s inception 

Weaknesses: 
●	Flawed reward structure for encouraging new growth. The first hotspot in a new location can only earn 1% of total rewards of the network because it cannot participate in the three most fruitful reward earning processes: location verification and data transfer. This will prevent the network from expanding to new locations quickly without an initial capital investment in growing the market in other areas. 
●	To ensure the security of Hotspots customers might actually need to invest in a firewall that prevents the most common attack vector to get into a device like the Hotspot is inbound ports.  The Helium Hotspot only requires one port open in both directions (TCP Port 44158), so all other inbound ports can be secured behind a firewall per your personal security needs. This will also stifle organic growth of helium hotspots in cities. 

Opportunities: 
●	Accelerate growth through by deciding to invest in 10 hotspots/city which will kick start organic growth for the network in that specific city. 
●	Create other attractive IoT devices (like the Helium tab) that incentivize new participants to join the network

Threats: 
●	IoT satellite technology reduces their price before helium can develop an extensive international network. For instance Swarm Technologies is providing low cost IoT network solutions via its satellites. If they establish enough of a foothold in the market at a low enough price to compete with Helium, it will be difficult for Helium to monetize their current freemium business model leading to potential network stagnation. Would recommend this article for an interesting read. Still no real insight into how the price would differ from Helium to Swarm.  https://medium.com/swarm-technologies/introducing-swarm-549b804f1fa1
