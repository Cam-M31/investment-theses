## Overview

For the last decade, we have been moving towards a world that is more geared towards the virtual, than the physical, and are now entering a phase that looks to further blur the lines between the virtual and the physical. Be it social media, movies, virtual reality, augmented reality – or even holographic worlds – this entire transition away from the physical has a few key components – and one of them is rendering. We’ve always used it – in the movies we’ve seen, the cartoons we watch, or even in professional scale modelling for architects. As the demand for rendering increases, so does the quality and speed of the renderer required. 
The Render Network offers fast and cheap rendering – that is GPU accelerated, and decentralised. 


## Investment Thesis

**Big Shift towards Virtual  and Augmented Reality, Animation Centric Spaces** 

As we have seen NFTs and the metaverse explode over the last year, and the gaming industry colossally grow over the last decade – it is pretty clear that we are moving towards a more virtual means of social interaction. People spend time socialising on their phones, or “in-game” as opposed to meeting physically – and this is extending beyond just instant messaging or video calls – as games, and now “metaverses” allow you to socially interact in a digital manner – while mimicking all the traits of a regular physical interaction. We have seen this with Fortnite – and in game concerts and events. For all of this to be possible, rendering, and fast rendering is key. In order for this space to scale vertically, rendering must also become magnitudes cheaper. 

**Core OTOY Software (Octane Render)**

The Render Network is run by OTOY.inc – a software company that provides the worlds fastest GPU-accelerated renderer – Octane. OctaneRender looks at harnessing GPU power instead of CPU power (as other renderers do) – which provides for rendering speeds that are order of magnitudes faster than other renderers. The core software is already amongst the most used for rendering jobs globally – with deals with Disney, HBO etc. 


**Rendering Alternatives are Too Expensive, Slow and Prohibitive to Individual Creators**

Rendering is intensive and expensive. For context, a decade ago, single frames would take 6 to 8 hours to render. Even today, quality rendering is expensive – and more often than not requires an expensive visual effects studio to get the job done. This was prohibitively expensive for any individual creators that wanted to get a render job finished. However, with Octane (and now the Render Network) – rendering was scaled – by distributing the compute power required across multiple GPU’s – that would process the render at the same time – significantly decreasing costs, as well as total time taken. Creators can now leverage the Render Network – submit a render job – and can expect it to be finished quickly, and cost effectively. 

**Idle GPU Computing Power** 

By targeting GPUs over  CPUs – The Render Network has a much bigger pool of computing power at its disposal. GPUs (or graphics cards) are everywhere – on phones, laptops, and even PoW crypto miners. As we transition towards a PoS ecosystem, and the number of graphics cards globally grows – there will be a lot of Idle GPU power to be leveraged -that would have otherwise gone unused. This creates economic incentives for GPU holders as well. 

**Rendering the Metaverse**

With the narrative around Metaverses growing – and more and more people transitioning to using digital avatars within digital metaverses to replicate (or replace) physical meet-ups (concerts, galleries, weddings  on Sandbox, Decentraland etc.) – the demand for live-stream, high quality renderers to execute the computation demands is high. As we move forward, the next step is optimistically making the experience more “life-like” via holographic representations. This type of rendering would need a core network that can simultaneously serve the demands, at fast speeds, and low costs – which Render already offers. 

**Active Network Participation Opportunities**

In order for large scale rendering to process, in a decentralised manner,  - an infrastructure of nodes would be required to constantly manage/validate render requests, payments, computations etc– creating an opportunity to actively participate in the network –– in return for economic incentives. 


## Industry Outlook

Currently, the entire 3D rendering market is around $4bn expected to grow to around $20bn by 2025. However, with the increasing demands for holographic renders – for games, individual creators etc. – this market could easily hit $50bn by 2025. Current competitors are – Corona, Lumion, Keyshot etc. that provide CPU rendering – and AWS, Azzure that provide cloud rendering. 


## Competitive Landscape

There are no other real competitors within the blockchain space that offer rendering – however, Arweave, Filecoin and Livepeer – offer other forms of decentralised computing power. They all have similar protocol economics – build out a vast array of nodes, incentivised by token rewards, and use the native token to pay for services that the distributed array of nodes can provide. 
Arweave, Livepeer and Helium and Filecoin are the best comparisons to Render - since they generate explicit revenues for their network usage. 

Explicit fees are the fees that users pay (in the protocol tokens) to render the service of the network. For example - you would pay for storage on Filecoin or Arweave, pay for streaming video on Livepeer, and pay for Data credits on Helium. 

It’s evident that these infrastructure protocols are quite overvalued as compared to the revenues they are generating - however, the number of users is concentrated given how nascent the space is. We expect to see user growth increase exponentially over time, as these products improve on UX, and find strong PMF. At the end of the day, they will be able to provide services identical to web2 at much lower costs. This will bring the users, and revenue. 

Since Render Network is going through system chananges, it is difficult to find any onchain data for network usage. However, according to the [latest data from the team](https://medium.com/render-token/behind-the-network-a48078658166), – the network has over 10,000 users, 300 creators and ~2.8M RNDR tokens of transactions on the network. This implies an annualized revenue of ~$1.4m. 

We expect this figure to grow significantly over the coming few years, led by a few headwinds: 

1. The Ethereum Merge is completed succesfully around the month of September 2022. This will mean that lots of Ethereum PoW mining equipment (GPU processing power) will be unprofitable, and will need to be redirected elsewhere. 
2. The current network is still in a transition phase, and nodes and users that can access the network are currently capped. Once the network completes its transition state, we should see a larger number of users onboarded that will significantly boost revenues. 


Looking at Render's Network next to other, similar protocols in the Web3 Space, it is quite clear that the protocol is significantly undervalued relative to all the other protocols – considering the high consistent demand there is for Rendering (or the utility the Render Network provides) compared to the other protocols.

## Technology:

The Render Token will be the primary unit utilized to exchange rendering and streaming services and proof-of-render work on the OctaneRender Cloud (ORC) network, OTOY’s cloud rendering marketplace. 

In its final form, the token will allow users to utilize the wide array of available GPUs in the peer-to-peer network, allowing for quick and reliable rendering facilitated and kept track of by the blockchain. 

Orc Network

Users (Creators) 

Users will create accounts on the Orc Network – that will be linked to a blockchain (initially Ethereum, plans to migrate to Solana) – through smart contracts and unique wallets. 
Users will have to purchase and store RNDR tokens on their accounts – in order to pay for rendering services on the network. 

When a user submits a render request - the network will send a request for a Render token smart contract in order to enter a transaction with both parties - the person or server processing the render/streaming and the person who requests the rendering services. The cost of the job will be calculated and determined in Render tokens. The smart contract will then transfer funds across accounts once the allotted render job has been completed.

Node Operators

Node Operators register their GPUs to the RNDR network to be "rented out" by Creators in need of additional power, and get paid RNDR tokens for time spent rendering. Currently, in order to be a node operator and join the network – one will need to fill out a form, and join a queue in order to be whitelisted, and added to the network. 

The Network

Let’s say you’re an individual who needs a quick rendering job done. 

* You would submit a task onto the Render Network
* The Network then calculates the cost of the task – based on demand and supply factors within the overall network, and then handles the transactions through a smart contract. 
* The user processing the job utilizes the idle GPU to perform the task – and then sends back the completed request through the network. 
* Once the task is reconciled – the smart contract releases the payment in RNDR tokens. 
* 1 RNDR = 256 seconds of work at 256 Octane bench (GPU unit benchmark)

The Network essentially co-ordinates and facilitates demand and supply for GPU compute power (render jobs – and allocates jobs across nodes. The network essentially functions like a marketplace. 


## Protocol Fees: 

* The protocol takes a 0.5% - 5% fee per render request – which is sent to the treasury. There is no information on whether these funds will be distributed to RNDR holders. 

## RNDR Tokenomics: (To be revised) 
Max Supply: 536,870,912 RNDR

Circulating Supply: 154,278,922 RNDR (28.74%)
 
Distribution:

* 25% - Token Sales 
* 10% - Team and Advisors (6- month lock-up)
* 65% - In Escrow

The RNDR max Supply is capped at 536,870,912 tokens, expected to be distributed overtime as per below: 
* 25% of the supply (118,047,397 tokens) was defined to be sold to the market, starting at the ICO (Oct. 6, 2017). Out of these, 13.6% (16,170,331 tokens) are estimated to have been sold during the private carried out between January 2018 and May 2018. 

* 65% of the supply (348,966,093 tokens) were stored as "escrow" and will flow to network as per supply/demand. According to founder's calculations (2018) this amount is enough to cover the supply/demand for rendering for the next 10-12 years. This flow is estimated to have started by Q1 2021. 

* 10% of the supply (53,687,091 tokens) is classified as RNDR Reserve, including founders and contributors. This had a 6 month lockup and is expected to flow to the market over time

Token Use cases: 

RNDR token is used to pay for render requests. 
(Staking, Rev share (potentially), and network security Tokenomics to be updated.) 


## SWOT Analysis

Strengths: 

* Decentralised rendering offers a true service that is better in all aspects than its centralised counterparts – and hence demand will always flow. 
* Octane render already has an existing user base that uses the centralised version – which they can easily port over to the network. 
* Expansion towards Solana – leveraging a higher throughput than Ethereum. 

Weaknesses:

* The protocol overall is quite centralised – and Octoy seems to control the primary decisions. 
* Relatively high FDV – indicating major token unlocks could be imminent. 

Opportunities: 

* There is a lot of idle GPU power, and the market is only growing. This can catalyse the network – and increase the pool of power it processes. 
* Metaverse and Gaming growth will need rendering – which is fast and scalable (cheap)
* Existing partnerships with major users of rendering services, like Warner, Disney, HBO

Threats:

* No real threats – apart from centralised control over the network. 
* Potentially, weak token value accrual for holders. 

## Management & Team

Founder: Jules Urbach (Founder and CEO of OTOY)

Team Size: 60+ 

## Catalysts: 

* Deals with Multicoin Capital, Alameda and Solana – to help grow the network – and bring rendering to Solana.
* Huge influx of users towards Metaverses and gaming. 
* Already existing user base of Octane Core engine. 
* GPU growth is exponential – expected market size to be $200bn in the next 5 years.
