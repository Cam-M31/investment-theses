## Overview

Abracadabra is a lending platform similar to MakerDao, but mainly focuses on interest-bearing tokens as collateral for their users to borrow their USD pegged stablecoin from. Users can then open self-repaying loans or build leveraged yield farming positions via Abracadabra. 

Abracadabra seeks to make MIM the default cross-chain decentralised stablecoin by deploying on multiple chains and creating MIM-bridges, already solving Arbitrum’s 7-day withdrawal issues. 

After SPELL’s recent pumps, it has become harder to justify an investment at it’s current TVL and profit levels when comparing to MKR. The discussion will be based upon how we value SPELL’s potential growth and current narrative/memes. However, yield farming its token seems like a good r/r.

## Background

Rehypothecation is one of largest edges that an institution or HNWI has over the public in finance. By being able to reuse collateral, these parties can access higher levels of capital efficiency than the general public. Though we have seen some applications of rehypothecation in DeFi i.e. borrowing from xSUSHI collateral on AAVE or borrowing from UniLP positions, Abrcadabra is the first to tackle rehypothecation of interest bearing assets enmasse. 

## Investment Thesis

**Rehypothecation of interest-bearing tokens (ibTokens)**
* ibToken holders can use Abracadabra to unlock liquidity to open leveraged positions or other reasons i.e. downpayment on a house. 
* Since Abracadabra charges a low interest rate, loans are self-paying. 
* If Abracadabra proves itself over time, there is little reason stablecoin yield farmers would not use Abracadabra to earn higher yields or unlock capital. 

**Cross-chain liquidity**
* Abracadabra is able to issue and burn MIMs on any chain, allowing users on Arbitrum to bridge MIMs to other chains without going through the 7-day withdrawal process. 
* Since other solutions require LPs on both sides i.e. Hop or Celer, these protocols may lack liquidity or charge high fees.
  * If the future consists of 100 chains, how much capital would LPs need to provide liquidity on each? MIM does not have that issue.

**Narrative Riding**
* Memes and narratives are the key drivers of price in crypto. 
* Fundamentals without a recognition from other investors = No narrative = No price discovery. 
* Abracadabra taking over MakerDAO is an easy narrative to ride, especially when coupling with Abracadabra’s explosive growth. 
* $115m TVL to $800m in <2 months. 
* MIM supply = 878m, DAI supply = 6.14b

## Catalysts
* More Dapps launching on Arbitrum = more demand for bridge liquidity.
 * More activity on other chains = more demand for bridge liquidity.
* Addition of more ibTokens as collateral.

## TAM & Valuation
* Comparative valuation with Maker
