## Overview

Abracadabra is a lending platform similar to MakerDao, but mainly focuses on interest-bearing tokens as collateral for their users to borrow their USD pegged stablecoin from. Users can then open self-repaying loans or build leveraged yield farming positions via Abracadabra. 

Abracadabra seeks to make MIM the default cross-chain decentralised stablecoin by deploying on multiple chains and creating MIM-bridges, already solving Arbitrum’s 7-day withdrawal issues. 

After SPELL’s recent pumps, it has become harder to justify an investment at it’s current TVL and profit levels when comparing to MKR. The discussion will be based upon how we value SPELL’s potential growth and current narrative/memes. However, yield farming its token seems like a good r/r.

## Background

Rehypothecation is one of largest edges that an institution or HNWI has over the public in finance. By being able to reuse collateral, these parties can access higher levels of capital efficiency than the general public. Though we have seen some applications of rehypothecation in DeFi i.e. borrowing from xSUSHI collateral on AAVE or borrowing from UniLP positions, Abrcadabra is the first to tackle rehypothecation of interest bearing assets enmasse. 

## Investment Thesis

**Rehypothecation of interest-bearing tokens (ibTokens)**
* ibToken holders can use Abracadabra to unlock liquidity to open leveraged positions or other reasons i.e. downpayment on a house. 
* Since Abracadabra charges a low interest rate, loans are self-paying. 
* If Abracadabra proves itself over time, there is little reason stablecoin yield farmers would not use Abracadabra to earn higher yields or unlock capital. 

**Cross-chain liquidity**
* Abracadabra is able to issue and burn MIMs on any chain, allowing users on Arbitrum to bridge MIMs to other chains without going through the 7-day withdrawal process. 
* Since other solutions require LPs on both sides i.e. Hop or Celer, these protocols may lack liquidity or charge high fees.
  * If the future consists of 100 chains, how much capital would LPs need to provide liquidity on each? MIM does not have that issue.

**Narrative Riding**
* Memes and narratives are the key drivers of price in crypto. 
* Fundamentals without a recognition from other investors = No narrative = No price discovery. 
* Abracadabra taking over MakerDAO is an easy narrative to ride, especially when coupling with Abracadabra’s explosive growth. 
* $115m TVL to $800m in <2 months. 
* MIM supply = 878m, DAI supply = 6.14b

## Catalysts
* More Dapps launching on Arbitrum = more demand for bridge liquidity.
 * More activity on other chains = more demand for bridge liquidity.
* Addition of more ibTokens as collateral.

## TAM & Valuation

* Comparative valuation with Maker

* SPELL is trading at a slight premium to $MKR in terms of MCAP/TVL and massive premium on FDV/TVL, but large discount on MCAP/PROFIT and FDV/PROFIT
* Growth potential
  * AAVE holds $5.96b of WETH earning 0.32% APR and Compound holds $5.7b earning 0.11% APY. Depositing that ETH into yvETH to earn 1.58% and being able to borrow from it on
  * Abracadabra should be more attractive to investors once Abracadabra has been in the market for a while. Capturing just 10% of that would increase TVL by $1b. 
  * Abracadabra can also tackle Yearn and Convex’s ibTokens, which have $4.71b and $7.8b of TVL respectively. 
  * MakerDAO is not deployed on other chains, unlike Abracadabra. 
  * Since launching in May, the team has quickly increased the amount of supported tokens and chain deployments, and have just recently executed a bridge between Arbitrum, Ethereum, AVAX, Fantom and BSC.
  * Convex has shown that it can easily disrupt a first-mover in DeFi, Yearn Finance. Abracadabra can do the same to MakerDAO.

* Dividend Discount Model
  * Based on our DDM, SPELL is undervalued by 2.5x.

  * If we were to value MakerDAO in the same way however, we would say MKR is highly overvalued.
  * Maybe we should question if our discount rates are too aggressive too.

## Industry Outlook
* Lending and rehypthecation is one of the chief use cases for DeFi.
* Unlike AAVE and Compound, MakerDAO and Abracadabra are more capital efficient, as they do not need a depositor to lend out tokens; instead of charging an intermediary fee, MakerDAO and Abracadabra can lend to borrowers directly, charge lower interest rates and earn all the fees.

## Competitors
* Traditional competitors – Banks and brokers
* Crypto Competitors – MakerDAO, AAVE, Compound

## Recent Trends & Changes
* Arbitrum launch may encourage more activity on borrowing due to lower gas and yield farming costs.

## Technology:
* Abracadabra utilises Kashi’s isolated lending markets to lend MIM to borrowers. 
  * This differs from other protocols i.e. AAVE which has cross-collateral functions. 
* Users can deposit their yield-bearing toens i.e. yvUSDC or yvWETH which are from Yearn.Finance and borrow MIM from those positions. (Also supports non yield-bearing tokens)
  * The protocol then charges a borrow fee at mint and an ongoing low-interest fee i.e. 0.8%. 
* Positions have a maximum collateral ratio, which when exceeded, a third party can liquidate their position for a fee.

## Token (SPELL): 
* SPELL can be staked for sSPELL, which receive protocol interest and borrow fees + 10% of the liqudation fees. Fees will be used to buyback SPELL from the market and distributed to stakers.

  * MIM-3LP3CRV Liquidity Incentives – 45%
  * Team – 30% (4 year vesting schedule)
  * ETH-SPELL Liquidity Incentives – 18%
  * IDO – 7%

## SWOT Analysis

Strengths: 
1. Tackling a large market gap in DeFi i.e. Borrowing from ibTokens and cross-chain bridges. 
2.	Narrative is for SPELL to overtake MKR. 
3.	Team of fast builders. 

Weaknesses: 
1.	Exposed to DAI/USDC/USDT depeg risks due to some LPs.
2.	Not being VC-funded also has some negative implications such as branding or strategic value-add. However, this means more tokens are in the hands of the community who are willing evangelists. 

Opportunities: 
1.	Marketcap is relatively small <$200m and FDV is still <$1b, and poised to disrupt MakerDAO. 
2.	Large incentives to yield farm their token which has real value, instead of most farm and dump tokens.

Threats: 
1.	The fast-moving nature and regular additions of tokens such as FTM and wsOHM increases risk of Abracadabra’s insolvency. 
2.	Arbitrum’s 7 day withdrawal time is there to ensure withdrawals are not fraudulent. There may be some risks to bridges that ignore the slower finality of Arbitrum.

* [Abracadabra multi-sig](https://twitter.com/MIM_Spell/status/1401478828116123648?s=20&t=IoYs5EIWE0SfAsPIPIDLkQ)
  * Abracadabra is under a multi-sig of well-known DeFi contributors, but also prone to centralisation risk.

## Management & Team

**Team:**

* Daniele Sesta
* GeorglyXo
* Squirrel
* Spirit of Ronny

Team is also responsible for Popsicle Finance and Wonderland.money

BoringCrypto licensed his isolated lending contract to Kashi and Abracadabra

## CRYPTO-NATIVE DILIGENCE

**Code Audits** 
The code has not been audited.

**Open Source Risk (Forking Risk)**
 * Moderate Forking Risk – tech stack (ibTKN pools) are unique to most liquidity aggregators, hence forking would be slightly hard.
