Audius – Investment Thesis (GitHub) 

## Overview 

Audius is a decentralized music streaming platform, that leverages blockchain technology to power distribution of music without the need for an intermediary third party (like a Universal Music, Spotify or Apple Music), directly allowing fans and their artists to interact with each other. 

## Background

Before diving into Audius and how they are looking to disrupt the music distribution space, we take a look at what the current industry looks like, and why we need these kinds of protocols to exist in order to democratize an increasingly gatekept legacy system. 

### Music Distribution is Highly Centralized, and Providers Abuse Power

There are two major aspects to music at a distribution level,

1.	[Music Rights and Ownership](https://blog.reverbnation.com/2018/05/09/music-law-101-owns-copyright-song/#:~:text=In%20general%2C%20the%20individual%20who,person%20owns%20the%20resulting%20copyrights.) – *who really owns a piece of music created?*

2.	[Music Distribution](https://soundcharts.com/blog/music-distribution) - *how is that piece of music distributed to consumers, and how it is monetized?*

When looking deeper into the two aspects above, the result may rather surprise you. It is not the artist (the creator of the music) that has a major share in ownership of the music created, nor the artist that gets to decide how and where their music is distributed and monetized. 

All these decisions are taken by centralized authorities and intermediaries like record labels, agents, and music streaming services. 

Pre-internet, the act of creating a piece of music and eventually monetizing it required lots of capital investment and administrative work (like dealing with [royalties](https://www.indiemusicacademy.com/blog/music-royalties-explained) and rights tracking) , which artists couldn’t afford and didn’t want to allocate their time towards. They outsourced this to record labels in exchange for a share of any expected future profit. While this may have seemed like a rational decision for musicians at the time, in hindsight, the upside for providing these services was so high (the record labels essentially went long artists success, VC style), that the record labels came out the biggest winners. They have managed to consolidate their position since, and today, a large amount of the artists successes, depends on the music label they sign with.

Music studios like Universal, Warner and Sony Music control a large amount of the music rights and ultimately decide who gets to do what with them, irrespective of who created the music, i.e., the artist. Owning the rights to music also means record labels can decide how that music is monetized, marketed, and distributed. The end result? They earn a lion’s share of any revenue generated, while the artist, literally, feeds on scraps.  

The two charts above are the perfect visualizations with the problems in the music distribution space today. 

* In 2021, the global music industry recorded $25.6bn in total generated revenue. The big three record labels (Universal, Sony, Warner) combined earned 68.6% of all of that revenue. The reason for this is simple – they own most of the music rights. 
* Diving a little deeper, and we see the second major problem in the space – of all the revenues generated in 2021, Intermediaries accounted for ~76%, while artists only earned 7%. The reason for this – again, artists end up giving up a large share of ownership in their music in exchange for distribution value. 

### Music is Streaming

COVID-19 accelerated the adoption and move towards a more digital centric world. The same can be said for the music distribution space. Today, there is one clear winner when it comes to how music is distributed (i.e., how the music ends up in the ears of the end user), and that is streaming platforms. Platforms like Spotify, Apple Music are the norm when it comes to music consumption. They provide immense value to listeners by providing them with large libraries of music available at any point in time. 

*The number of paid streaming subscriptions over the last 12 years have grown at 42% CAGR, which is incredible*

Streaming platforms have translated their high demand into the driving source for revenue in the music industry today, accounting for 65% of the total amount of revenue earned by various sources. The big downside to this is that streaming protocols become price makers (since artists, and even music labels need them for music discovery), and we have seen them do so. Streaming platforms earn 20% of the total revenue generated from music. 

These arguments pretty much sum up the major problems with the current web2 music distribution architecture – artists are underpaid and undervalued relative to the value they create (unequal value distribution), and centralized entities (record labels and streaming platforms) control both content discovery as well as monetization potential. While there are other issues like royalty payments, opaque old systems etc. – we believe these are the biggest two problems within the space right now – both of which Audius looks to tackle.
