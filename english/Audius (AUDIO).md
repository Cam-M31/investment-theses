## Overview 

Audius is a decentralized music streaming platform, that leverages blockchain technology to power distribution of music without the need for an intermediary third party (like a Universal Music, Spotify or Apple Music), directly allowing fans and their artists to interact with each other. 

## Investment Thesis

Before diving into Audius and how they are looking to disrupt the music distribution space, we take a look at what the current industry looks like, and why we think we need these kinds of protocols to exist in order to democratize an increasingly gatekept legacy system. 

### Music Distribution is Highly Centralized, and Providers Abuse Power

There are two major aspects to music at a distribution level,

1.	[Music Rights and Ownership](https://blog.reverbnation.com/2018/05/09/music-law-101-owns-copyright-song/#:~:text=In%20general%2C%20the%20individual%20who,person%20owns%20the%20resulting%20copyrights.) – *who really owns a piece of music created?*

2.	[Music Distribution](https://soundcharts.com/blog/music-distribution) - *how is that piece of music distributed to consumers, and how it is monetized?*

When looking deeper into the two aspects above, the result may rather surprise you. It is not the artist (the creator of the music) that has a major share in ownership of the music created, nor the artist that gets to decide how and where their music is distributed and monetized. 

All these decisions are taken by centralized authorities and intermediaries like record labels, agents, and music streaming services. 

Pre-internet, the act of creating a piece of music and eventually monetizing it required lots of capital investment and administrative work (like dealing with [royalties](https://www.indiemusicacademy.com/blog/music-royalties-explained) and rights tracking) , which artists couldn’t afford and didn’t want to allocate their time towards. They outsourced this to record labels in exchange for a share of any expected future profit. While this may have seemed like a rational decision for musicians at the time, in hindsight, the upside for providing these services was so high (the record labels essentially went long artists success, VC style), that the record labels came out the biggest winners. They have managed to consolidate their position since, and today, a large amount of the artists successes, depends on the music label they sign with. 

 <img width="800" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96482943/184709790-02e935a2-f044-45b0-aa74-128496648e60.png">


Music studios like Universal, Warner and Sony Music control a large amount of the music rights and ultimately decide who gets to do what with them, irrespective of who created the music, i.e., the artist. Owning the rights to music also means record labels can decide how that music is monetized, marketed, and distributed. The end result? They earn a lion’s share of any revenue generated, while the artist, literally, feeds on scraps.  

The two charts above are the perfect visualizations of the problems in the music distribution space today. 

* In 2021, the global music industry recorded $25.6bn in total generated revenue. The big three record labels (Universal, Sony, Warner) combined earned 68.6% of all of that revenue. The reason for this is simple – they own most of the music rights. 
* Diving a little deeper, and we see the second major problem in the space – of all the revenues generated in 2021, Intermediaries accounted for ~76%, while artists only earned 7%. The reason for this – again, artists end up giving up a large share of ownership in their music in exchange for distribution value. 

### Music is Streaming 

 <img width="700" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96482943/184711340-57da0b4c-0fd4-4abc-b18a-9e43dbaab0a7.png">

 
COVID-19 accelerated the adoption and move towards a more digital centric world. The same can be said for the music distribution space. Today, there is one clear winner when it comes to how music is distributed (i.e., how the music ends up in the ears of the end user), and that is streaming platforms. Platforms like Spotify, Apple Music are the norm when it comes to music consumption. They provide immense value to listeners by providing them with large libraries of music available at any point in time. 

*The number of paid streaming subscriptions over the last 12 years have grown at 42% CAGR, which is incredible*

<img width="700" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96482943/184711373-d74c1380-ee57-41b0-8277-015939dc0bfd.png">
 
Streaming platforms have translated their high demand into the driving source for revenue in the music industry today, accounting for 65% of the total amount of revenue earned by various sources. The big downside to this is that streaming protocols become price makers (since artists, and even music labels need them for music discovery), and we have seen them do so. Streaming platforms earn 20% of the total revenue generated from music. 

These arguments pretty much sum up the major problems with the current web2 music distribution architecture – artists are underpaid and undervalued relative to the value they create (unequal value distribution), and centralized entities (record labels and streaming platforms) control both content discovery as well as monetization potential. While there are other issues like royalty payments, opaque old systems etc. – we believe these are the biggest two problems within the space right now – both of which Audius looks to tackle. 

## Industry Outlook & TAM

As discussed earlier in this report, Music Streaming platforms are the preferred method of music consumption today, with global subscribers crossing 520 million across various platforms. These platforms have been able to secure streaming deals with a wide range of artists, while also allowing independent artists to upload their content onto the platform. These vast libraries, and the ability to offer instant music availability, at any point in time have driven massive user growth over the recent past. 

Subscribers have grown at an impressive 42% CAGR over the last decade plus, an indication of their popularity to listeners. It is also no surprise that streaming platforms account for 65% of the total global revenue earned from music distribution, and 85% of total US revenue generated.

<img width="600" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96482943/184784021-b1f500f5-03ba-422d-abf7-0a93adaea2fd.png">

The overall streaming market is worth ~$30bn today, and is expected to grow at 14.7% CAGR over the next decade, which would value the TAM at roughly $118bn. 

Realistically speaking, it will be difficult for Audius to usurp the streaming giants like Spotify or Apple music as they have a massive advantage when it comes to library sizes. However, there is still 20% of the market that isn’t dominated by the major players, and this is where Audius can uniquely position itself to attract users. 

<img width="149" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96482943/184784046-10a5de2e-13e6-46c9-9d31-9ce695cc79b0.png">

Audius can attract artists by providing higher streaming revenues to them. If Audius is able to capture 50% of the streaming market that doesn’t consist of the big players, it is looking at a TAM of ~$11.8bn over the next decade

## Technology - How it Works 

### Network Participants

1.	**Artists** – They produce the content, and upload it onto Audius for discovery, distribution, and monetization. 
2.	**Fans** – They consume the content produced by artists, and engage with the artists and the protocol. 
3.	**Content Ledger** – This is the main ledger for the protocol, which contains the node registry, and other important information. 
4.	**Content Nodes** – These are servers that host content and permission access to it. 
5.	**Discovery Nodes** – These are the servers that are responsible for indexing the main ledger and allowing users and developers to query it.

### Content Nodes 

Content Nodes host and store all the content that the artists upload onto the protocol. Audius has an extension to IPFS called AudSP (Audius Storage Protocol), which is a decentralized storage protocol that stores all the content and metadata. Users are incentivized to run content nodes (by staking AUDIO tokens) and provide storage space to the network, by earning a share in AUDIO token emissions and a share in protocol fees. 

<img width="400" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96482943/184724791-72d217b2-3efd-48ca-971b-60610743e690.png">

*Source: [Audius Whitepaper](https://whitepaper.audius.co/AudiusWhitepaper.pdf)*

Here’s what content nodes do: 

1.	When an artist uploads a piece of music onto Audius – it is broken up into smaller segments, and distributed across content nodes that encrypt and store the segments. 
2.	When users want to stream the music, they request access to the specific segments of music/songs they want to listen to from the content nodes that store the data. (This all happens on the back end, to users, they are just clicking “[play](https://audius.co/)”)
3.	Content Nodes allow for content permissioning functions, which can restrict who can access the content based on a set of pre-defined conditions. This is extremely useful when artists want to run their own content nodes. They could use on-chain data (like holding a specific amount of the artists token, proof of past history) to restrict access to specific pieces of music to only super fans etc. 

### Content Ledger 

The Audius Content Ledger, is a group of smart contracts deployed on the various blockchains that house various components of the protocol (Ethereum, Filecoin Solana etc.), and is the ultimate source of truth for anything that happens on the protocol. 
The Content ledger includes: 

* Audio content and metadata [format specifications](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/56d5e44060b5e9e20a94b16c/t/5b493e3f03ce642cc82b5890/1531526720147/OMI-MVI1.0-Requirements+(20170726)+(2).pdf)
* Processes for artists to track content and control ownership structure & revenue splits
* Registry of all nodes reachable on the protocol
* Social Graph for all users interacting with the protocol
* Implementations of the governance token model 

### Discovery Nodes 

Discovery nodes, similar to content nodes, are servers that Index the content ledger (where artists register new music, and the history of the network state rests), allowing artists, users and developers to query the ledger and extract valuable, important information. These nodes essentially allow for new music to be discovered on the Audius Network, as well as allow other applications to be built on top of it, using the API.  This is a massive component in providing high user experience to fans and artists alike. 

<img width="400" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96482943/184731259-9815d59f-bee5-4cb4-893e-1cf92a5bec2f.png">

*Source: [Audius Whitepaper](https://whitepaper.audius.co/AudiusWhitepaper.pdf)*

Nodes are incentivized to provide the service by earning AUDIO token emissions and a potential share in protocol revenue. 

## Tokenomics and Protocol Mechanics

The Audius protocol is powered by the Audius platform token ($AUDIO), and 3rd-party stablecoins as well as artist-specific tokens will be supported in the future. 

### Utility

The AUDIO token has three main use cases within the network: 

* Security 
* Feature access 
* Governance 

Audius tokens are staked as collateral for a value added services. In exchange, stakers earn ongoing issuance, governance weight and access to exclusive features. Audius tokens are staked by node operators to run the Audius protocol, and by artists and curators to unlock exclusive features and services. Any $AUDIO staked within the protocol is assigned governance weight, used to shape future iterations of the protocol. Audius tokens will serve as collateral for artist-based tooling as well. 

Early examples incubated by the community include artists tokens, badges and earnings multipliers. In the future, fans may delegate tokens to specific artists and curators to share in their growth on the platform and the issuance of future tokens. Node operators must stake Audius tokens to operate a discovery node or content node, with a larger stake correlating to a higher probability of being chosen by fan clients. 

### Token Distribution 

**Genesis Supply:** 1,000,000,000 AUDIO

**Annual Issuance Rate:** 7% (70,000,000 AUDIO)

## SWOT Analysis

### Strengths 

* The protocol provides creators with an open platform to enable discovery and monetization of their content. 
* It allows fans to engage with artists in unique ways, controlled by onchain activity. 
* Artists earn much more revenue from streaming as compared to regular streaming providers, as Audius only charges 10% of all revenues earned. Additionally, creators can choose how they would like to monetize their content, which they cannot do on other streaming platforms. 
* Ownership of music rights can be fractionalized on-chain, unlocking new ways of financing. 
* It removes the need and over-reliance on centralized protocols for music discovery. 

### Weaknesses  

* The initial bootstrapping of the protocol depends heavily on building out a strong supply side of popular artists, before more regular indie creators can start to feel the network effects of the protocol. 
* Since the ultimate driver of streaming demand is having large libraries of music, Audius may find it difficult to attract too many users given the small number of artists on the protocol. 
* Because of the nature of the protocol, Audius is more aligned towards independent, smaller artists with relatively smaller fan bases as compared to the mainstream big names. This will lead to an initial lag in terms of user growth. 

### Opportunities  

* Only the really famous musicians end up making good revenues from streaming platforms, while smaller independent artists who may not be able to generate millions of streams a year (which reinforces the algorithm to push them lower down in the list for discovery), suffer as a result of the pricing system these centralized platforms have set. Audius could be a perfect solution for independent artists like these. 
* Audius creates new engagement channels between artists and their fans, that were not possible earlier, like token gated access to content, closed events, special access to artists etc. In fact, artist tokens give fans a unique opportunity to go long their favorite artists, and even capture some of the upside if the artist ends up becoming extremely successful. It is like an added provable layer (that is lucrative in $ terms) to [bragging rights of discovering an artist early.](https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/spotify-found-them-first-6692383/) 

### Threats 

* The off-chain enforceability of on-chain IP rights is still a major point of contention and regulatory scrutiny
* The overall market is full of competition, Spotify and Apple Music dominate the music streaming space with large music libraries and large user bases that are willing to pay a premium to access those libraries. 
* A large amount of the token supply was allocated to investors and the team (~76%)

## Catalysts 

* Introduction of [Audio Tipping](https://blog.audius.co/article/introducing-audio-tipping) – where fans can send micropayments as “tips” to their favorite artists on the protocol. This is the first of a large set of monetization features that the protocol can introduce.
* Major UX Improvements with addition of [notifications](https://blog.audius.co/article/receive-notifications-when-your-track-is-added-to-a-playlist), [playlist folders](https://blog.audius.co/article/introducing-playlist-folders) and [NFT integrations](https://blog.audius.co/article/audius-nfts-and-wallets-faq) with layer 1 blockchain Solana
* [Integrations](https://blog.audius.co/article/audius-the-graph-mainnet-launch-partner) with the Graph protocol for Indexing 


## Protocol Metrics

Despite being in beta and servicing a small number of artists, Audius has managed to gain impressive traction. In fact, it is one of the most widely used web3 protocols. 

<img width="600" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96482943/184761608-feec874c-959c-492b-8151-2f703a808b1e.png">

As of July 2022,

* Audius has one of the largest user bases of all web3 protocols, with an average monthly user base of 2.89m over the last year. Monthly users have grown 329% since launch of the protocol
* In terms of usage (number of times a song has been streamed on the protocol), Audius sees ~6.2m streams a month on average, up roughly +214% over the last year. In totality, the protocol has seen ~87m streams 
* There are more than 7 applications that leverage the Audius API, and have made over a billion API calls
