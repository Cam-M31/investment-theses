## M31's Investment Thesis
**1. [x]**

In 2020, we saw the emergence of Decentralized Finance which saw the bootstrapping of a number of protocols that offer traditional (and new primitive) financial services using smart contracts. In 2021, we saw the emergence of DAOâ€™s as the key stakeholderin Web3 organizations. Tokemak fits perfectly into the intersection between DeFi and Web3 in the sense that it is a decentralized investments protocol, run by a DAO that effectively becomes the liquidity layer in DeFi allowing participants to manage assets from the protocol do earn the highest yields via liquidity deployments across the DeFi ecosystem. TOKE holders form a decentralized team of asset managers.
